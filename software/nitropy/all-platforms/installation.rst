.. contents:: :local:

This guide explains how to install nitropy with `pipx <https://pypa.github.io/pipx/>`_.  pipx creates a virtual environment for nitropy.  This means that nitropy and its dependencies donâ€™t conflict with other packages installed on your system.

------------

* Python 3.6 or newer 

  Python is already installed on most macOS and Linux systems or can be downloaded from `python.org <https://python.org>`_.  See the `Downloading Python Guide <https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download>`_ for more information.
* pip
  
  You can install pip with your system package manager or with ``python3 -m ensurepip``.  See the `pip Installation Guide <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/>`_ for more information.
