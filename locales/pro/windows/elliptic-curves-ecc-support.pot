msgid "For security reasons, the German Federal Office for Information Security (Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik, BSI) no longer recommends RSA keys with a length of 2048 bit `to be used after 2022 <https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Publications/TechGuidelines/TG02102/BSI-TR-02102-1.pdf;jsessionid=064DAA7AD3195C1C87B1C71B2760DB4E.1_cid360?__blob=publicationFile&v=7>`__. This means that longer keys will need to come into use in the foreseeable future. Assuming a usage period of five years, is is already necessary to generate longer keys. However, longer RSA keys with 3072 bit or 4096 bit are significantly slower. For this reason the new Nitrokey Storage 2 and Pro 2 (resp. the integrated OpenPGP Card version 3.3) supports encryption by means of `elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography>`__. This method is considered to be just as secure with smaller ECC keys as longer RSA keys and is also considerably faster."

msgid "In contrast to RSA, there are many different forms (so-called curves) of elliptic-curve cryptography. Notably, the `NSA was involved <https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2007/11/did_nsa_put_a_secret.html>`__ in the development of the NIST curves. Even if there is no evidence of back doors in the curves, using a certain curve can pose a question of trust. Fortunately the new Nitrokey Storage 2 and Pro 2 support two kind of curves, namely NIST and Brainpool. In what follows we will use Brainpool curves. `This article <https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/10/a-relatively-easy-to-understand-primer-on-elliptic-curve-cryptography/>`__ provides a good entry point for gaining a general understanding of elliptic-curve cryptography."

The newest GnuPG version for Windows can be found `here <https://www.gpg4win.org/>`__ and the newest version for MacOS can be found `here <https://gpgtools.org/>`__. A suitable version of GnuPG is included in the GNU/Linux distributions Ubuntu (since 18.04), Debian (from Stretch onwards), Arch Linux, Fedora (from Release 26 onwards) and openSUSE Tumbleweed. At the end of this articles are instructions how to manually update GnuPG on older Ubuntu versions."

All communication partners must use GnuPG 2.1 or newer for email encryption by means of ECC, otherwise incompatibility issues might arise. Therefore you should only use ECC if you are sure you will be able to circumvent this problem."

msgid "Once these requirements are fulfilled, you can get started. (Warning: existing keys will be overwritten in the process!) You now have two options. The first option is to create the key directly on the Nitrokey Storage 2 / Pro 2. The benefit here is that the key will never be outside the device and as such can never be read out. The second option is to import a previously locally generated key. The advantage in this case is that you can securely store a backup of the key, which can then be restored in case the Nitrokey is lost. Only the first option is described below. In order to create a key with backup, you can access `the following instructions <https://www.gniibe.org/memo/software/gpg/keygen-25519.html>`__ and use this `general information <https://wiki.fsfe.org/TechDocs/CardHowtos/CardWithSubkeysUsingBackups>`__ to transfer the key to the Nitrokey."
