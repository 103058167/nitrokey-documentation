"With the NitroPad X230, malicious changes to the BIOS, operating system, "
"and software can be easily detected. For example, if you left your "
"NitroPad in a hotel room, you can use your Nitrokey to check if it has "
"been tampered with while you were away. If an attacker modifies the "
"NitroPad’s firmware or operating system, the Nitrokey will detect this "
"(instructions below)."

"The box marked in red contains the information that the BIOS has not been"
" changed and that the shared secret of the NitroPad and the Nitrokey "
"match. But this information is not sufficient, because an attacker could "
"have faked it. If at the same time the Nitrokey also flashes green, "
"everything is fine. An attacker would have to have had access to the "
"NitroPad and Nitrokey to achieve this result. It is therefore important "
"that you do not leave both devices unattended."
