"For security reasons, the German Federal Office for Information Security "

" This means that longer keys will need to come into use in the "
"foreseeable future. Assuming a period of use of five years, safer keys "
"should already be being generated. However, longer RSA keys with 3072 bit"
" or 4096 bit are significantly slower. For this reason `Nitrokey Start "
"<https://shop.nitrokey.com/shop/product/nitrokey-start-6>`__ (resp. the "
"underlying firmware `Gnuk <https://www.fsij.org/category/gnuk.html>`__) "
"has been supporting encryption by means of `elliptic-curve cryptography "
"(ECC) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography>`__ for "
"some time. This method is considered to be just as secure for smaller key"
" systems as longer RSA keys and is also considerably faster."

"In contrast to RSA, there are many different forms (so-called curves) of "
"elliptic-curve cryptography. Notably, the `NSA was involved "
"<https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2007/11/did_nsa_put_a_secret.html>`__"
" in the development of the NIST curves. Even if there is no evidence of "
"back doors in the curves, using a certain curve can pose a question of "
"trust. Fortunately the Nitrokey Start supports multiple curves, namely "
"NIST, SECG and Curve25519. In what follows we will use Curve25519 and "
"Ed25519 that is based upon this, both of which have a good reputation and"
" are considered to be secure. `This article <https://arstechnica.com"
"/information-technology/2013/10/a-relatively-easy-to-understand-primer-"
"on-elliptic-curve-cryptography/>`__ provides a good entry point for "
"gaining a general understanding of elliptic-curve cryptography."

"You can learn about the installed version of GnuPG via ‘gpg2 –version’. "

"version of GnuPG is included in the GNU/Linux distributions Debian (from "
"Stretch onwards), Arch Linux, Fedora (from Release 26 onwards) and "
"openSUSE Tumbleweed. Unfortunately only GnuPG 2.1.15 is currently "

"Once these requirements are fulfilled, you can get started. (Warning: "
"existing keys will be overwritten in the process!) You now have two "
"options. The first option is to create the key directly on the Nitrokey "
"Start. The benefit here is that the key will never be outside the device "
"and as such can never be read out. The second option is to import a "
"previously locally generated key. The advantage in this case is that you "
"can securely store a backup of the key, which can then be restored in "
"case the Nitrokey is lost. Only the first option is described below. In "
"order to create a key with backup, you can access `the following "
"instructions "
"<https://www.gniibe.org/memo/software/gpg/keygen-25519.html>`__ and use "
"this `general information "
