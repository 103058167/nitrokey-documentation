msgid "4. Change the Admin PIN (default: ``12345678``) and then the User PIN (default: ``123456``) to your own choices. - The PIN must consist of at least 14 characters (starting from RTM.8), can contain any character (not only numbers). Do not select only numbers. If your environment allows that, use emoticons or national characters. - The longer the PIN the better. It is possible to use 6 randomly selected words instead as well for the same or better security than random character string. - Use ‘gpg –card-edit’ -> ‘admin’ -> ‘passwd’ to achieve this (for Admin PIN case). - Please be careful to change Admin PIN first and User PIN second! Otherwise the admin-less mode got activated, see `this instructions <https://www.fsij.org/doc-gnuk/gnuk-passphrase-setting.html#>`__ for further information. - Optionally Reset code can be set up (`guide <http://www.fsij.org/doc-gnuk/gnuk-passphrase-setting.html#set-up-pw1-pw3-and-reset-code>`__). The minimum length accepted is 8 characters, however it should be as long as User PIN. 5. KDF-DO allows for a shorter PIN of 8 characters minimum, by executing part of the calculations on the PC. Please use greater length for the increased security."

While OpenPGP/GnuPG is popular among individuals, S/MIME/x.509 is mostly used by enterprises. If you are in doubt which one to choose, you should use OpenPGP."
