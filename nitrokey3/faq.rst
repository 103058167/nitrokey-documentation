Nitrokey 3 FAQ
==================

**Q:** Which Operating Systems are supported?
   Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. Also some support for Android and iOS.

**Q:** What can I use the Nitrokey for?
   See the `frontpage`_ for an overview of supported use cases.

**Q:** What happens if I lose my device?
   When securing accounts using FIDO (two-factor authentication and
   passwordless login), you should configure another factor in your account as
   a backup. Depending on the service this backup factor can be a phone number,
   an app or even a second Nitrokey FIDO2. If you lose a device, you
   can still log in with the second Nitrokey (or with another second
   factor).

**Q:** How large is the storage capacity?
   The Nitrokey 3 doesn't contain storage capability for ordinary data (it can
   only store cryptographic keys and certificates).
