Nitrokey FIDO2 FAQ
===========

**Q:** What happens if I lose my FIDO device?
   When securing accounts using FIDO (two-factor authentication and
   passwordless login), you should configure another factor in your account as
   a backup. Depending on the service this backup factor can be a phone number,
   an app or even a second Nitrokey FIDO2. If you lose a Nitrokey FIDO2, you
   can still log in with the second Nitrokey FIDO2 (or with another second
   factor).
