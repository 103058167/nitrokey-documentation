1. Once you plug in the Nitrokey, your computer will start the Keyboard
   Setup Assistant. **Donâ€™t run through this assistant but exit it right
   away.**
2. Download and start the `Nitrokey
   App <https://www.nitrokey.com/download>`__. Follow the
   `instructions <change-pins.html>`__
   to change the default User PIN (default: 123456) and Admin PIN
   (default: 12345678) to your own choices.

Your Nitrokey is now ready to use.
`Checkout <https://www.nitrokey.com/documentation/applications>`__ the
various use cases and supported applications.

.. note::

   -  For some Versions of MacOS it is necessary to install custom `ccid
      driver <https://github.com/martinpaljak/osx-ccid-installer>`__
      (for information see
      `here <https://ludovicrousseau.blogspot.com/2016/04/os-x-el-capitan-and-ccid-driver-upgrades.html>`__),
      but in general MacOS should have the driver onboard.

   -  For many use cases described, it is necessary to have either
      OpenPGP or S/MIME keys installed on the device (see below).

Key Creation with OpenPGP or S/MIME
-----------------------------------

There are two widely used standards for email encryption. While
OpenPGP/GnuPG is popular among individuals, S/MIME/x.509 is mostly used
by enterprises. If you are in doubt which one to choose, you should use
OpenPGP.

-  `instructions <openpgp.html>`__
   for using the OpenPGP standard with the Nitrokey

-  `instructions <smime.html>`__
   for using S/MIME with the Nitrokey
