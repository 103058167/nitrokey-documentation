**Q:** Pricing and VAT

The Nitrokey GmbH has a heterogeneous customer base, private and enterprise customers, from Germany as well as inside and outside of the EU. With the pricing we want to ensure that all customers pay a uniform rate. For example, a large international corporation should pay just as much as a German private customer. Accordingly, the gross price (incl. VAT) for German private customers equals the net price (excluding VAT) for EU enterprise customers and all customers outside of the EU. This approach has been audited and is legally correct.

**Q:** How is the Bitcoin exchange rate calculated?

At the time of ordering, our system takes the exchange rate from blockchain.info and adds 10% on top of it. The 10% are for our handling fees (exchanging Bitcoins back to Euro) and for the risk implicated by floating exchange rate.

**Q:** How to return goods?



To return a goods (e.g. Nitrokey):

    In case of a hardware defect, you can contact us and we will send you a shipping label.
    Pack the device in an air cushion envelope (not in an ordinary envelope!).
    Include the delivery slip or printout of the invoice with the shipment.
    Add a note of the reason for the return, e.g. "Withdrawal of the purchase" or "Exchange due to defect". It is sufficient to note the reason in handwriting on the enclosed invoice or delivery note.
    Address the mailing to our address.
