Factory Reset
=======================


.. Warning::

   Factory Resetting your NextBox will inevitably **delete all your files** on
   the NextBox and any configuration settings.

**To factory reset your NextBox simply press the hardware button for 5 seconds.**

The NextBox LED will change to *blue* once you press the button, after the 5
seconds have passed the color will change to blinking red (see :doc:`LED documentation <led-colors>`).
Once the LED has finally reached *green* again your NextBox is ready for the initial setup as 
described in :doc:`Getting Started <../gettingstarted>`
